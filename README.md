# Book Tracker
Book read tracker with stats

# Description
This is a book tracker in the style of MyAnimeList anime list. Currently the basic features are implemented, but needs more advanced functionality. Books can currently be added, edited, and rated. Books are saved locally so that way the session will be maintained for the future. Future features that need to be added are more stylings, notes, and clicking on elements to edit them without hitting the edit button.

This project was a refresh, given there was gap between now and last time using Javascript. I would like to make this project 1 to 1 with MyAnimeList in terms of style and features in the future.
